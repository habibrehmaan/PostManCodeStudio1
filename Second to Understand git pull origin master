This is the second file I am adding to Remote Repo.
The purpose is to undestand how we can download these files onto local repo.
C:WhereYOuWantToDownload>git clone https://github.com/habibrehmaan/PostManCodeStudio1.git (link from the remote repo)
This command will download the entire code from github for the very first time.
Next time when you download the updated code, you will use PULL command only not CLONE.
So second time when downloading the updated code or additional file 
git pull origin master
